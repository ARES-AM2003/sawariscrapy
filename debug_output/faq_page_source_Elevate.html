Sure, you could put engine specifications, safety features and warranty on glossy paper. However, aspects such as reliability, build quality and trust are built over time and cannot be used as marketing material.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/honda-elevate/20250512_183735/930x620/Elevate-2720250512_183735.jpg" title="Honda Elevate"></p> 
<p>Thankfully, the Elevate wears a Honda badge, so all these intangible aspects are almost a given. Honda has thankfully backed it up with a solid product that makes for a very sensible choice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It goes up against popular models such as the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Maruti Grand Vitara and the Tata Curvv to name a few. So why should you be considering the Honda? Let’s take a closer look.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="expand  viewmore threedots undefined bottomLinkBlack" data-track-section="" data-track-component="pagecontent"><span data-read-more="1" class="slLink hover lessCls">Read More</span></div></div></div><div id="specification_1" data-id="Exterior" class="toggleAccordion specsFeaturesBlock"><h3 class="gsco_header gsc_co_open">Exterior</h3><div id="ExpertReviewOverviewData_1" class="featuresIocnsSec gsco_content "><div class="gs_readmore model-highlight tableTopPara    " style="height:100px"><p><strong>Design and Quality</strong></p>  
<p>Forget the glossy brochure pictures. In person, out in the real world, the Elevate stands tall and upright. There’s oodles of road presence and you will get your fair share of attention on the road.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate front three quarters" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_183916/930x620/Elevate-3520250512_183916.jpg" title="Honda Elevate front three quarters"></p> 
<p>In typical Honda fashion, the design isn’t taking any unnecessary risks. It’s simple, strong and powerful. The connection to Honda’s global lineup of SUVs is amply evident in the flat-nose with a large gloss black grille. Pair that with a high-set bonnet, and a thick slab of chrome above the full-LED headlamps — you’ve got a face that exudes confidence.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The bumper sports a plain design, with minimal creases. I liked the integration of the white LED foglamps into the rugged-looking black housing. Honda has also added a subtle silver-finished skid plate up front for that outdoorsy vibe.</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate profile" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_183852/930x620/Elevate-2820250512_183852.jpg" title="Honda Elevate profile"></p> 
<p>The side profile seems almost too simplistic. Save for the interesting elements on the lower half of the doors, the profile is clean — devoid of any sharp creases. Its tall height is also highlighted when viewed from this angle. Honda provides 17-inch dual tone alloy wheels on the top spec variants, whereas lower trims get 16-inch steel wheels.</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate rear three quarters" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_183943/930x620/Elevate-2920250512_183943.jpg" title="Honda Elevate rear three quarters"></p> 
<p>From the rear, the obvious highlight is the connected tail lamp design element. We wish this entire unit was LED and not just the brake lamps. Honda has used halogen bulbs for the indicators and reverse lamps, which seems unnecessary for an SUV in this segment.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In terms of size, the numbers are right where they should be. It’s standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its arch rivals — the Creta, Seltos and the Grand Vitara. The number that’s likely to get your attention, however, is the large 220mm of ground clearance. Nothing speaks ‘for India’ in the design as much as this does!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Elevate feels solidly built with tight shut lines and great paint quality. Honda cars generally age well, and this SUV is expected to be no different.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Honda offers seven monotone shades: Phoenix Orange Pearl, Golden Brown Metallic, Obsidian Blue Pearl, Meteoroid Gray Metallic, Radiant Red Metallic, Lunar Silver Metallic, and Platinum White Pearl. If you want a dual-tone paint option from the factory, you can get a black roof paired with the Phoenix Orange Pearl, Radiant Red Metallic, and Platinum White Pearl body shade.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate Signature Black Edition" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184001/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Statics420250512_184001.jpg" title="Honda Elevate Signature Black Edition"></p> 
<p>Honda also offers a Crystal Black paint shade, which is exclusive to the Black Edition.</p></div><div class="expand  viewmore threedots undefined bottomLinkBlack" data-track-section="" data-track-component="pagecontent"><span data-read-more="1" class="slLink hover lessCls">Read More</span></div></div></div><div id="specification_2" data-id="Interior" class="toggleAccordion specsFeaturesBlock"><h3 class="gsco_header gsc_co_open">Interior</h3><div id="ExpertReviewOverviewData_2" class="featuresIocnsSec gsco_content "><div class="gs_readmore model-highlight tableTopPara    " style="height:100px"><p><strong>Design and Quality</strong></p>  
<p>The doors of the Elevate open nice and wide. Getting in and out won’t be a task, even for the elderly. You tend to ‘walk’ into the cabin, which is easy on the knees.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate cabin" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184106/930x620/Elevate-8220250512_184106.jpg" title="Honda Elevate cabin"></p> 
<p>Once in, the classy tan-black color combination has you saying ‘classy’ almost immediately. Honda has chosen to keep the theme subdued and sombre, with dark grey highlights around the AC vents (instead of the usual chrome) and dark grey stitching for the upholstery too. The wooden insert on the dash gets a dark shade too. The wrap around effect of the tan from the dashboard ‘spilling over’ onto the door pads is executed neatly too, making the cabin feel a lot more cohesive.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate front seats" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184134/930x620/Elevate-4520250512_184134.jpg" title="Honda Elevate front seats"></p> 
<p>Honda seems to have hit the nail on the head in terms of material quality. The plastic used on the dashboard top, AC vents and the climate control interface seems high quality. Soft touch leatherette on the dashboard and door pads do their bit in amping up the experience.&nbsp;</p>  
<p><strong>Front Seats</strong></p> 
<p>The driver’s seat can be adjusted for height, and the steering gets tilt and telescopic adjustment. Finding the right driving position is very easy. The seating position is tall, even at its lowest setting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate front seats" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184421/930x620/Elevate-5620250512_184421.jpg" title="Honda Elevate front seats"></p> 
<p>The obvious advantage to this is that you get a clear view of the nose — important if you’re new to driving. An obvious flipside is for those taller than 6ft or those who wear turbans, you’d find yourself close to the roof. A non-sunroof model should have better headroom at the front.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In terms of comfort, there’s nothing to complain about. The seats are wide and very accommodating of large frames. There’s ample support for the back and shoulder. I liked the slightly firm cushioning too, which was great on longer drives.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>On the passenger side, the portion below the central AC vents juts out by design. This might brush your&nbsp; knee or shin which will have you move the seat a notch further back than usual. Thankfully, even doing that leaves plenty of legroom for the rear seat passengers.</p>  
<p><strong>Rear Seats</strong></p> 
<p>At the rear, knee room is among the best in the segment. A six footer like me was able to comfortably fit behind a 6’5” tall driver. The floor under the seats is raised, turning it into a natural footrest. There are no complaints about headroom, either. The roof liner is scooped from the sides, creating a bit more space. Cabin width is decent. Three people can squeeze in if needed. However, there's neither a headrest nor a 3-point seat belt for the middle occupant.</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate rear seats" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184154/930x620/Elevate-6420250512_184154.jpg" title="Honda Elevate rear seats"></p> 
<p>This makes the cabin perfect for 4 adults and 1 child. Rear seat amenities include a central armrest, and rear AC vents. Rear sunblinds would’ve been nice to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  
<p><strong>Storage and Practicality</strong></p> 
<p> Inside the cabin, there's no shortage of practicality - cupholders in the center console, storage in the armrest, and large bottle holders in the door pockets. In addition, there are thin storage slots for keeping your phone or keys.</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate central armrest storage" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184555/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details9520250512_184555.jpg" title="Honda Elevate central armrest storage"></p> 
<p>Rear seat occupants can use seatback pockets that have dedicated smaller pockets for your phones.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate seat back pocket" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184214/930x620/Elevate-8420250512_184214.jpg" title="Honda Elevate seat back pocket"></p> 
<p><strong>Charging Options</strong></p>  
<p>At the front, Honda provides a wireless charger (which can be switched off) along with a 12V socket and two USB type-A chargers. Rear seat occupants have to make do with a single 12V socket. Honda could’ve provided fast USB type-C chargers both at the front and rear.</p>  
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>  
<p>The top-spec version of the Elevate brings with it all that you’d use on a daily basis. Basics such as keyless entry, push-button start stop, wireless charger, climate control, rear AC vents, and a single-pane sunroof are offered.</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate infotainment system" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184515/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details4320250512_184515.jpg" title="Honda Elevate infotainment system"></p> 
<p>The highlight is the new 10.25-inch touchscreen, which Honda is introducing for the first time. The interface is simple, responsive, and has good resolution. It's definitely better than the Honda City's infotainment system. It supports wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay which functions as intended with no glitches or freezes. Paired with a crisp sounding 8-speaker sound system, the Elevate’s infotainment experience is satisfactory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second highlight is the part-digital driver display, borrowed from the City. A 7-inch LCD screen blends seamlessly with the analogue speedometer to form one cohesive cluster. Here too, graphics are sharp, and all vital information is available at a glance. You can control the screen by using the switches on the steering wheel.&nbsp;</p>  
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate sunroof" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184537/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details11020250512_184537.jpg" title="Honda Elevate sunroof">While all the basics are covered, the Elevate isn’t standing out in any manner in terms of features. Rivals offer features such as powered seats, front seat ventilation, 360 degree cameras, head up displays and a panoramic sunroof, all of which are missing on the Elevate. That said, the top-spec variant of the Elevate is available at the mid-spec or one below top variants of its rivals, and seems adequately equipped in that context.</p></div><div class="expand  viewmore threedots undefined bottomLinkBlack" data-track-section="" data-track-component="pagecontent"><span data-read-more="1" class="slLink hover lessCls">Read More</span></div></div></div><div id="specification_3" data-id="Safety" class="toggleAccordion specsFeaturesBlock"><h3 class="gsco_header gsc_co_open">Safety</h3><div id="ExpertReviewOverviewData_3" class="featuresIocnsSec gsco_content "><div class="gs_readmore model-highlight tableTopPara    " style="height:100px"><p>Honda offers safety features such as 6 airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX child seat mounts, electronic stability control and hill start assist right from the base SV variant. Weirdly enough, Honda does not provide a tyre pressure monitoring system with the Elevate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate rear-view camera" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184640/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details4420250512_184640.jpg" title="Honda Elevate rear-view camera"></p> 
<p>Adding to the safety quotient of the Elevate is a host of ADAS functions. This includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, and auto emergency braking. Do note that the Elevate uses a camera-based system and not a radar-based one like the Kia Seltos or the MG Astor. This will limit functionality in low visibility conditions such as rain/fog and also at night. Also, since there are no radars in the rear you do not get blind-spot monitoring or rear cross-traffic alert.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The Honda Elevate has not been crash tested by GlobalNCAP or BharatNCAP yet. However, it has been tested by JapanNCAP, where the made-in-India Elevate (called WR-V in Japan) scored a full five star safety rating.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="expand  viewmore threedots undefined bottomLinkBlack" data-track-section="" data-track-component="pagecontent"><span data-read-more="1" class="slLink hover lessCls">Read More</span></div></div></div><div id="specification_4" data-id="Boot Space" class="toggleAccordion specsFeaturesBlock"><h3 class="gsco_header gsc_co_open">Boot Space</h3><div id="ExpertReviewOverviewData_4" class="featuresIocnsSec gsco_content "><div class="gs_readmore model-highlight tableTopPara    " style="height:100px"><p>The Elevate’s 458-litres of boot is among the largest in the segment. It can comfortably accommodate a full suitcase set, consisting of a cabin-sized, medium and large trolley bag and have space left over for a couple duffle bags and backpacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate boot space" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184741/930x620/Elevate-5120250512_184741.jpg" title="Honda Elevate boot space"></p> 
<p>Honda also offers a 60:40 split on the rear seat in case you want to carry more luggage. It’s appreciable that the seat folds entirely flat, giving you a large and wide storage area that can be used to move larger items such as furniture or appliances if needed.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="expand  viewmore threedots undefined bottomLinkBlack" data-track-section="" data-track-component="pagecontent"><span data-read-more="1" class="slLink hover lessCls">Read More</span></div></div></div><div id="specification_5" data-id="Performance" class="toggleAccordion specsFeaturesBlock"><h3 class="gsco_header gsc_co_open">Performance</h3><div id="ExpertReviewOverviewData_5" class="featuresIocnsSec gsco_content "><div class="gs_readmore model-highlight tableTopPara    " style="height:100px"><p>Powering the Elevate is the City’s tried-and-tested 1.5-litre engine. Nope, no turbo-petrol, no hybrid, no diesel. Just one engine option for you. You do get to choose between a manual and a CVT, though.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate engine bay" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184827/930x620/Elevate-8720250512_184827.jpg" title="Honda Elevate engine bay"></p> 
<p>This four-cylinder engine is smooth, relaxed, and refined. Compared to the other 1.5-litre petrol motors in the segment, performance is on par. It’s not particularly engaging or exciting, but simply gets the job done.&nbsp;</p>  
<p><strong>City Performance</strong></p> 
<p>Power is built smoothly, which means driving in the city is easy. Light controls make the process easier still. The Elevate makes most of its power at high rpm. Therefore, to make quick progress you will have to rev the engine out. It’s best to adapt a relaxed driving style which the smooth engine complements very well. You can amble around town in second gear for the most part. However, you will need to downshift to ensure the engine does not feel strained while pulling from lower rpm.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate " src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184852/930x620/Elevate-2020250512_184852.jpg" title="Honda Elevate "></p> 
<p>I’d urge you to make the stretch to the CVT. It makes the experience even more relaxing. The CVT is tuned to mimic a torque convertor. So it ‘upshifts’ as the speeds climb, giving a very natural feel to the drive experience.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Inside the city, you can expect the Elevate to return 12-13kmpl.&nbsp;</p>  
<p><strong>Highway Performance</strong></p> 
<p>There’s enough power on tap to comfortably cruise at triple digit speeds. However, it’s not as exciting or punchy as some of the turbo-petrol options in the segment. If you intend on making relaxed intercity trips where you are usually driving between 80-100kmph, the Elevate will work just fine.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Honda Elevate paddle shifter" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184908/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details7420250512_184908.jpg" title="Honda Elevate paddle shifter"></p> 
<p>You’d be left wanting for more power in two scenarios. First: on hilly roads with full load, where you'll need to use 1st or 2nd gear. Second: on highways while wanting to overtake at speeds above 80kmph. Here too, a downshift (or two) might be needed.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="expand  viewmore threedots undefined bottomLinkBlack" data-track-section="" data-track-component="pagecontent"><span data-read-more="1" class="slLink hover lessCls">Read More</span></div></div></div><div id="specification_6" data-id="Ride and Handling" class="toggleAccordion specsFeaturesBlock"><h3 class="gsco_header gsc_co_open">Ride and Handling</h3><div id="ExpertReviewOverviewData_6" class="featuresIocnsSec gsco_content "><div class="gs_readmore model-highlight tableTopPara    " style="height:100px"><p>Honda has tuned the suspension for comfort over outright handling. It performs well on smooth roads and doesn't toss you around on bad ones. At low speeds, over large craters, most SUVs in this segment toss you around side to side. None of that in the Elevate. Nothing out of the ordinary to report in terms of high-speed stability or cornering ability. It performs as you’d expect a Honda to. It’s sharp, predictable and easy to manage at all times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steering is light and easy in the city, making parking and tight maneuvers easy. It weighs up enough at high speeds, inspiring confidence in the driver.&nbsp;</p>

 <li dir="ltr"> <p>The one-above-base V variant of the Honda Elevate can be considered if you’re on a tight budget and want an automatic.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
 <li dir="ltr"> <p>The top variant of the Honda Elevate offers good overall value.</p> </li>

The Elevate is a value for money product that’s hard to ignore. It could have done with more features (even at additional cost) and more exciting engine options would’ve definitely found more takers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, when you judge the Elevate upon its original intent, that of being a no-nonsense family SUV, it is very hard to fault. It is an SUV that prioritises comfort, space, quality and safety over everything else — making it very easy to recommend.</p>

Sure, you could put engine specifications, safety features and warranty on glossy paper. However, aspects such as reliability, build quality and trust are built over time and cannot be used as marketing material.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/honda-elevate/20250512_183735/930x620/Elevate-2720250512_183735.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate\"></p> \n<p>Thankfully, the Elevate wears a Honda badge, so all these intangible aspects are almost a given. Honda has thankfully backed it up with a solid product that makes for a very sensible choice.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It goes up against popular models such as the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Maruti Grand Vitara and the Tata Curvv to name a few. So why should you be considering the Honda? Let’s take a closer look.&nbsp;</p>","expertReviewTitle":"Honda Elevate Overview"},{"title":"Exterior","description":"<p><strong>Design and Quality</strong></p>  \n<p>Forget the glossy brochure pictures. In person, out in the real world, the Elevate stands tall and upright. There’s oodles of road presence and you will get your fair share of attention on the road.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate front three quarters\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_183916/930x620/Elevate-3520250512_183916.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate front three quarters\"></p> \n<p>In typical Honda fashion, the design isn’t taking any unnecessary risks. It’s simple, strong and powerful. The connection to Honda’s global lineup of SUVs is amply evident in the flat-nose with a large gloss black grille. Pair that with a high-set bonnet, and a thick slab of chrome above the full-LED headlamps — you’ve got a face that exudes confidence.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>The bumper sports a plain design, with minimal creases. I liked the integration of the white LED foglamps into the rugged-looking black housing. Honda has also added a subtle silver-finished skid plate up front for that outdoorsy vibe.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate profile\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_183852/930x620/Elevate-2820250512_183852.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate profile\"></p> \n<p>The side profile seems almost too simplistic. Save for the interesting elements on the lower half of the doors, the profile is clean — devoid of any sharp creases. Its tall height is also highlighted when viewed from this angle. Honda provides 17-inch dual tone alloy wheels on the top spec variants, whereas lower trims get 16-inch steel wheels.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate rear three quarters\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_183943/930x620/Elevate-2920250512_183943.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate rear three quarters\"></p> \n<p>From the rear, the obvious highlight is the connected tail lamp design element. We wish this entire unit was LED and not just the brake lamps. Honda has used halogen bulbs for the indicators and reverse lamps, which seems unnecessary for an SUV in this segment.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>In terms of size, the numbers are right where they should be. It’s standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its arch rivals — the Creta, Seltos and the Grand Vitara. The number that’s likely to get your attention, however, is the large 220mm of ground clearance. Nothing speaks ‘for India’ in the design as much as this does!&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Elevate feels solidly built with tight shut lines and great paint quality. Honda cars generally age well, and this SUV is expected to be no different.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>Honda offers seven monotone shades: Phoenix Orange Pearl, Golden Brown Metallic, Obsidian Blue Pearl, Meteoroid Gray Metallic, Radiant Red Metallic, Lunar Silver Metallic, and Platinum White Pearl. If you want a dual-tone paint option from the factory, you can get a black roof paired with the Phoenix Orange Pearl, Radiant Red Metallic, and Platinum White Pearl body shade.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate Signature Black Edition\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184001/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Statics420250512_184001.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate Signature Black Edition\"></p> \n<p>Honda also offers a Crystal Black paint shade, which is exclusive to the Black Edition.</p>","expertReviewTitle":"Honda Elevate Exterior"},{"title":"Interior","description":"<p><strong>Design and Quality</strong></p>  \n<p>The doors of the Elevate open nice and wide. Getting in and out won’t be a task, even for the elderly. You tend to ‘walk’ into the cabin, which is easy on the knees.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate cabin\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184106/930x620/Elevate-8220250512_184106.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate cabin\"></p> \n<p>Once in, the classy tan-black color combination has you saying ‘classy’ almost immediately. Honda has chosen to keep the theme subdued and sombre, with dark grey highlights around the AC vents (instead of the usual chrome) and dark grey stitching for the upholstery too. The wooden insert on the dash gets a dark shade too. The wrap around effect of the tan from the dashboard ‘spilling over’ onto the door pads is executed neatly too, making the cabin feel a lot more cohesive.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate front seats\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184134/930x620/Elevate-4520250512_184134.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate front seats\"></p> \n<p>Honda seems to have hit the nail on the head in terms of material quality. The plastic used on the dashboard top, AC vents and the climate control interface seems high quality. Soft touch leatherette on the dashboard and door pads do their bit in amping up the experience.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p><strong>Front Seats</strong></p> \n<p>The driver’s seat can be adjusted for height, and the steering gets tilt and telescopic adjustment. Finding the right driving position is very easy. The seating position is tall, even at its lowest setting.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate front seats\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184421/930x620/Elevate-5620250512_184421.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate front seats\"></p> \n<p>The obvious advantage to this is that you get a clear view of the nose — important if you’re new to driving. An obvious flipside is for those taller than 6ft or those who wear turbans, you’d find yourself close to the roof. A non-sunroof model should have better headroom at the front.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>In terms of comfort, there’s nothing to complain about. The seats are wide and very accommodating of large frames. There’s ample support for the back and shoulder. I liked the slightly firm cushioning too, which was great on longer drives.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>On the passenger side, the portion below the central AC vents juts out by design. This might brush your&nbsp; knee or shin which will have you move the seat a notch further back than usual. Thankfully, even doing that leaves plenty of legroom for the rear seat passengers.</p>  \n<p><strong>Rear Seats</strong></p> \n<p>At the rear, knee room is among the best in the segment. A six footer like me was able to comfortably fit behind a 6’5” tall driver. The floor under the seats is raised, turning it into a natural footrest. There are no complaints about headroom, either. The roof liner is scooped from the sides, creating a bit more space. Cabin width is decent. Three people can squeeze in if needed. However, there's neither a headrest nor a 3-point seat belt for the middle occupant.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate rear seats\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184154/930x620/Elevate-6420250512_184154.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate rear seats\"></p> \n<p>This makes the cabin perfect for 4 adults and 1 child. Rear seat amenities include a central armrest, and rear AC vents. Rear sunblinds would’ve been nice to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  \n<p><strong>Storage and Practicality</strong></p> \n<p> Inside the cabin, there's no shortage of practicality - cupholders in the center console, storage in the armrest, and large bottle holders in the door pockets. In addition, there are thin storage slots for keeping your phone or keys.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate central armrest storage\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184555/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details9520250512_184555.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate central armrest storage\"></p> \n<p>Rear seat occupants can use seatback pockets that have dedicated smaller pockets for your phones.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate seat back pocket\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184214/930x620/Elevate-8420250512_184214.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate seat back pocket\"></p> \n<p><strong>Charging Options</strong></p>  \n<p>At the front, Honda provides a wireless charger (which can be switched off) along with a 12V socket and two USB type-A chargers. Rear seat occupants have to make do with a single 12V socket. Honda could’ve provided fast USB type-C chargers both at the front and rear.</p>  \n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>  \n<p>The top-spec version of the Elevate brings with it all that you’d use on a daily basis. Basics such as keyless entry, push-button start stop, wireless charger, climate control, rear AC vents, and a single-pane sunroof are offered.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate infotainment system\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184515/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details4320250512_184515.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate infotainment system\"></p> \n<p>The highlight is the new 10.25-inch touchscreen, which Honda is introducing for the first time. The interface is simple, responsive, and has good resolution. It's definitely better than the Honda City's infotainment system. It supports wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay which functions as intended with no glitches or freezes. Paired with a crisp sounding 8-speaker sound system, the Elevate’s infotainment experience is satisfactory.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate digital driver's display\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184339/930x620/Elevate-6720250512_184339.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate digital driver's display\"></p> \n<p>The second highlight is the part-digital driver display, borrowed from the City. A 7-inch LCD screen blends seamlessly with the analogue speedometer to form one cohesive cluster. Here too, graphics are sharp, and all vital information is available at a glance. You can control the screen by using the switches on the steering wheel.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate sunroof\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184537/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details11020250512_184537.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate sunroof\">While all the basics are covered, the Elevate isn’t standing out in any manner in terms of features. Rivals offer features such as powered seats, front seat ventilation, 360 degree cameras, head up displays and a panoramic sunroof, all of which are missing on the Elevate. That said, the top-spec variant of the Elevate is available at the mid-spec or one below top variants of its rivals, and seems adequately equipped in that context.</p>","expertReviewTitle":"Honda Elevate Interior"},{"title":"Safety","description":"<p>Honda offers safety features such as 6 airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX child seat mounts, electronic stability control and hill start assist right from the base SV variant. Weirdly enough, Honda does not provide a tyre pressure monitoring system with the Elevate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate rear-view camera\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184640/930x620/Honda-Elevate-RT-Details4420250512_184640.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate rear-view camera\"></p> \n<p>Adding to the safety quotient of the Elevate is a host of ADAS functions. This includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, and auto emergency braking. Do note that the Elevate uses a camera-based system and not a radar-based one like the Kia Seltos or the MG Astor. This will limit functionality in low visibility conditions such as rain/fog and also at night. Also, since there are no radars in the rear you do not get blind-spot monitoring or rear cross-traffic alert.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>The Honda Elevate has not been crash tested by GlobalNCAP or BharatNCAP yet. However, it has been tested by JapanNCAP, where the made-in-India Elevate (called WR-V in Japan) scored a full five star safety rating.&nbsp;</p>","expertReviewTitle":"Honda Elevate Safety"},{"title":"Boot Space","description":"<p>The Elevate’s 458-litres of boot is among the largest in the segment. It can comfortably accommodate a full suitcase set, consisting of a cabin-sized, medium and large trolley bag and have space left over for a couple duffle bags and backpacks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate boot space\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184741/930x620/Elevate-5120250512_184741.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate boot space\"></p> \n<p>Honda also offers a 60:40 split on the rear seat in case you want to carry more luggage. It’s appreciable that the seat folds entirely flat, giving you a large and wide storage area that can be used to move larger items such as furniture or appliances if needed.&nbsp;</p>","expertReviewTitle":"Honda Elevate Boot Space"},{"title":"Performance","description":"<p>Powering the Elevate is the City’s tried-and-tested 1.5-litre engine. Nope, no turbo-petrol, no hybrid, no diesel. Just one engine option for you. You do get to choose between a manual and a CVT, though.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate engine bay\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184827/930x620/Elevate-8720250512_184827.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate engine bay\"></p> \n<p>This four-cylinder engine is smooth, relaxed, and refined. Compared to the other 1.5-litre petrol motors in the segment, performance is on par. It’s not particularly engaging or exciting, but simply gets the job done.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p><strong>City Performance</strong></p> \n<p>Power is built smoothly, which means driving in the city is easy. Light controls make the process easier still. The Elevate makes most of its power at high rpm. Therefore, to make quick progress you will have to rev the engine out. It’s best to adapt a relaxed driving style which the smooth engine complements very well. You can amble around town in second gear for the most part. However, you will need to downshift to ensure the engine does not feel strained while pulling from lower rpm.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Honda Elevate \" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250512_184852/930x620/Elevate-2020250512_184852.jpg\" title=\"Honda Elevate \"></p> \n<p>I’d urge you to make the stretch to the CVT. It makes the experience even more relaxing. The CVT is tuned to mimic a torque convertor.
