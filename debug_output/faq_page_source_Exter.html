It offers excellent value for money, plenty of modern features, and a smooth, comfortable drive. However, if you prefer sharper handling, need enough space at the back for three adults, or want a model with a confirmed crash-test rating, you might want to explore other options. Overall, the Exter ticks most boxes for first-time buyers and small families  it?s practical, well-equipped, and looks great on the road.","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"CarDekho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","Height":"240px","Width":"60px","url":"https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/CarDekho-Logo.jpg"}},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4.6"}},{"datePublished":"Nov 01, 2025","@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Prem Kumar"},"name":"My Experience With Exter Knight Pro SX SE","reviewBody":"I bought this latest model oct 2025 built exter SX Knight Pro SE.

The cabin is so quiet that sometimes you have to check whether the car is on ignition or not. The features packed into this car will give jealous pangs to owners of cars that are 4-5 lakhs more expensive. The AMT is so good you may sometimes forget its not a pure automatic. The car is easy going, great for cities and stable on highways. The boot is quite big for its segment. From inside Exter appears more spacious than cars 1 segment above.

This is a car built with a major focus on commercial and utility purposes. And in that sense, the Eeco is a well-made car. But the moment you look at it from an all-rounder point of view, it has its fair share of misses.</p> 
<p>Having understood its category of buyers, it has just about the enough stuff that they would be in need of for their daily commutes, which includes a large boot and the ability to carry many people or loads of luggage or cargo while offering a good ride quality. So it doesn’t need the touchscreens or gadgets and creature comforts of the cars from today, though it still packs the absolute essentials.</p> 
<p>That said, we did feel Maruti should have upped its game a bit when it comes to giving the Eeco a little softer suspension along with equipping it with must-have features like power steering and central locking to further ease the driver’s duties. But all said and done, the basic people mover is indeed good at doing what it does the best and that’s moving people or cargo from its pickup point to the destination.</p>

Its tall, boxy, has flat profiles, and rugged cladding, all of these things do give it a butch look. And since it is a Hyundai, you also get some thoughtful premium touches.</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter front three quarters" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172123/930x620/Exter_Beauty_1520250515_172123.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter front three quarters"></p>  
<p>At the front, the main highlights are the H-shaped DRLs which sit on top of the squarish halogen headlamps placed lower on the grille. The grille itself is pretty slim as Hyundai has added a chunky bumper with a skid plate to make the face look muscular.</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter side profile" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172149/930x620/_61C135220250515_172149.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter side profile"></p>   
<p>From the side, the proportions look odd but they have tried to give a boxy look. The 15-inch dual-tone alloy wheels look good and the dual-tone colour also helps it look a little premium. Lower variants of the Exter get 14-inch steel and 15-inch styled steel wheels.</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter 15-inch alloy wheels" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172240/930x620/_61C135120250515_172240.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter 15-inch alloy wheels"></p>   
<p>The rear profile of the Exter is a little polarising because it looks a little too flat, although Hyundai has tried to give some elements like these H-shaped LED taillights and the spoiler on top make the design also look digestible.</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter rear" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172213/930x620/_61C135320250515_172213.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter rear"></p>   
<p>Hyundai offers the Exter in 8&nbsp;monotone shades: Ranger Khaki, Starry Night, Fiery Red, Atlas White, Titan Grey, Titan Grey Matte, Shadow Grey&nbsp;and Abyss Black. Atlas White and Ranger Khaki are also available in a dual-tone shade. If you want your Exter to look different, you can pick the Knight edition, which comes with a Shadow Grey exterior colour along with an all-black interior theme.</p> 
<p>Moreover, Hyundai is offering a Pro Pack with the Exter, which brings in bolder wheel arches and a silver side sill plate that makes it look more rugged than the regular model.</p> 
<p>While the Exter might not appeal to everyone, I for one liked the design, as it's something different, and that too done right. It fulfils the purpose of looking like a big car to a certain extent, and the one detail I liked the most was the lighting setup, which is on point.</p></div><div class="expand  viewmore threedots undefined bottomLinkBlack" data-track-section="" data-track-component="pagecontent"><span data-read-more="1" class="slLink hover lessCls">Read More</span></div></div></div><div id="specification_2" data-id="Interior" class="toggleAccordion specsFeaturesBlock"><h3 class="gsco_header gsc_co_open">Interior</h3><div id="ExpertReviewOverviewData_2" class="featuresIocnsSec gsco_content "><div class="gs_readmore model-highlight tableTopPara    " style="height:100px"><p><strong>Design &amp; Quality</strong></p> 
<p>The Exter is tall, but not tall enough to cause issues during ingress and egress. With 185mm of ground clearance, getting inside is pretty easy. The wide opening doors and the tall roof make it even easier and effortless.</p> 
<p>Inside, the cabin design is the same as the Grand i10 Nios. The Exter’s interior has an all-black theme whose monotony is broken by its contrast-colour elements. You get these on the AC controls and AC vents, and these are body coloured. Even the piping on the seats are of the same exterior colour.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter interior" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172341/930x620/Exter_Interior_120250515_172341.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter interior"></p> 
<p>The quality of the plastics used is also good. The one on the top is smooth and the 3D pattern looks good. However, the design is a bit too similar to Tata’s tri-arrow pattern. Other than that, all the controls – like the AC, buttons on the steering, and window switches – feel very tactile.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter AC vents" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172410/930x620/_61C136520250515_172410.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter AC vents"></p> 
<p>Even the upholstery is a combination of fabric and leatherette which feels premium. But this high quality experience is limited to the upper part of the dashboard and the touchpoints. If the same was carried onto the door pads or the plastics below the dashboard, it would have been much better.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Front Seats</strong></p> 
<p>While the drive seat height adjustment is available from the base variant, tilt steering wheel adjustment is available from the SX Smart variant, so finding our ideal driving position will definitely require some time. But, the standard height of the seat should be right for most people.</p> 
<p>As for the front seats, they offer decent space. While the headroom is ample, the underthigh support is just average, and the seat is also a little narrow, which will not provide good space for broader individuals. The side support, on the other hand, is good.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Due to your tall driving position, wide windows and windshield, and no major blind spots, you get a commanding view of the road with good overall visibility.</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter front seats" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172506/930x620/_61C136320250515_172506.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter front seats"></p> 
<p><strong>Rear Seats</strong></p> 
<p>The seat cushioning is soft and the seat base is a little raised which allows you to sit comfortably. Knee room and foot room is ample even for someone 6ft tall, and the headroom is excellent. The only real issue starts when you try to seat three passengers here, as the limited width will make this quite a squeeze.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rear passengers also get good visibility due to the large windows, but the dark cabin theme can make them feel cramped. A rear centre armrest is also missing.</p>

<p>Front passengers get 1-litre bottle holders in both front doors, a big glovebox, two small cupholders in the centre console, an open storage on the dashboard, and a slot to keep your key.</p> 
<p>But the storage is a little less for rear passengers. You get door pockets but there is no armrest, no cup holders and the seat back pocket is only given behind the passenger seat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter central console" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172646/930x620/Exter_Interior_1720250515_172646.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter central console"></p> 
<p><strong>Charging Options</strong></p> 
<p>Charging options are plenty. You have a type-C port and a USB port up front. The 12V socket has a wireless charger plug in but you can use it like a USB port. But if you want a 12V socket, you get that at the back as well.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The overall cabin experience of the Exter is nothing out of the ordinary, but Hyundai has done a nice job with the cabin quality and space. It is not a 5 seater, and there is room for improvement but the space and practicality is enough for four.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Features</strong></p> 
<p>Given its price and segment, the Hyundai Exter gets a good features list, and here are some of the daily use equipment.</p>

<p>You also get an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which has an easy to understand interface, big icons, and it rarely lags. Android Auto &amp; Apple CarPlay work as intended, however, they are wired only..</p>  
<p>This setup is paired with a 4-speaker sound system which might not provide great audio quality, especially at higher volumes, but it's enough to get you through the day.</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter driver's display" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172618/930x620/_61C138720250515_172618.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter driver's display"></p> 
<p>There’s also a semi-digital instrument cluster whose readouts are very big and clear and the MID in the centre is also very detailed. Along with your drive information and trip information, you also get a tyre pressure display which is a really handy feature.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter sunroof" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172716/930x620/_61C138920250515_172716.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter sunroof"></p> 
<p>It also gets a wireless phone charger, which charges your phone at a fast pace, but it tends to heat up your phone quickly, which stops the charging. There’s a single pane sunroof as well, which does bring in additional light into this dark cabin, and makes it feel a little airier.</p> 
<p>Then comes the dual-camera dash cam with a front and in-cabin camera. Nowadays, many buyers are installing aftermarket dash cams because of the increasing safety incidents on the road, so a factory fitted option is a very good thing.</p></div><div class="expand  viewmore threedots undefined bottomLinkBlack" data-track-section="" data-track-component="pagecontent"><span data-read-more="1" class="slLink hover lessCls">Read More</span></div></div></div><div id="specification_3" data-id="Safety" class="toggleAccordion specsFeaturesBlock"><h3 class="gsco_header gsc_co_open">Safety</h3><div id="ExpertReviewOverviewData_3" class="featuresIocnsSec gsco_content "><div class="gs_readmore model-highlight tableTopPara    " style="height:100px"><p>The base variant of the Exter gets 6 airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control (ESC),, hill hold assist, rear parking sensors, 3-point seatbelts for all passengers, and ISOFIX child seat anchors.</p> 
<p>Higher variants get a tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS), a rear defogger, day and night IRVM, and a rear parking camera.</p> 
<p>The rear camera’s feed is acceptable during the day and there is no noticeable frame drop, but the feed becomes grainy at night or in low light conditions.</p> 
<p>While the Exter does not have a safety rating, its hatchback twin, the Grand i10 Nios, scored only 2/5 stars in Global NCAP crash tests.</p>

Also, because of its good height, you can keep two suitcases on top of each other.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A weekend’s luggage should be no problem for the Exter. And if you want to load larger articles, just remove this tray and fold this seat, and you can keep long stuff in here as well. There is no 60:40 split available.</p>  
<p>In the CNG variant, you get two small CNG tanks instead of a single big one, which does leave some space in the boot. Here, you can fit two cabin sized suitcases and a small soft bag, but nothing more.&nbsp;</p>

This engine is also available with a factory-fitted CNG kit that is offered only with a manual transmission.</p>

<p><strong>1.2-litre NA Petrol</strong></p> 
<p>As soon as you start driving, you realise that the refinement is good and the cabin remains quiet and relaxed at city speeds. However, this engine does feel a little lethargic at highway speeds and on inclines.</p> 
<p><strong>City Performance&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>This engine is made for an effortless commute experience and not for performance seekers. However, when it comes to commuting, it is indeed effortless. The power delivery is very smooth and the acceleration linear. City overtakes and speed changes from 20 to 40kmph, and 40 to 60kmph are done easily.</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter AMT gear lever" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_173234/930x620/Exter_Interior_1620250515_173234.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter AMT gear lever">The Exter gets an AMT transmission for convenience and in my opinion, that is the one almost everyone should get. The logic behind its gear shift is very good and the gearbox understands when you have to downshift for acceleration, and again upshifts for cruising. This keeps the engine in a comfortable band, so you never feel the lack of power.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And most importantly, the gears shifts are quick, for AMT standards. Plus, for the first time, you get paddle shifters along with an AMT, for better manual control. If you don't want to spend extra, then the manual transmission won't let you complain either. The clutch is light, gear shifts slot in easily and the ease of driving is maintained.</p> 
<p>The fuel efficiency in the city will be around 13-14kmpl.</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter " src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_173356/930x620/Exter_Tracking_3320250515_173356.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter "></p> 
<p><strong>Highway Performance</strong></p> 
<p>As soon as you get on the highway, and start to accelerate, you realise that this engine starts to feel a bit out of breath. Overtakes over 80kmph will require a lot of accelerator usage and here the engine feels noisy as well. You will need to plan your overtakes in advance and getting to triple digit speeds will also take some time.</p> 
<p>If you are looking for an exciting drive, then this engine could feel disappointing. The lack of power is felt at higher revs and that is where a turbo petrol engine option could have come in handy. The Nios’ older 1-litre turbo petrol would be a perfect fit here. If Hyundai would have given that option, then this car could have proved to be a better all-rounder.</p>

<p>The Hyundai Exter’s suspension is set up to focus more on low speed comfort. Given that it is going to spend most of its kilometres in the city, the suspension is set up on the softer side. We drove the Exter over bumpy roads, off the road and on the broken roads – and we can say that the suspension is very balanced. You don't feel the imperfection of the roads much and even the blogger bumps don't make you uncomfortable. Speedbreakers are well cushioned, and even the potholes won't make you feel nervous. And it is quick to settle as well so long road trips will also be comfortable.</p> 
<p>However, with a full passenger load, the bumps are felt more easily and while the ride is fine in the front row, rear seat occupants may find the suspension to be a bit bouncy at highway speeds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img alt="Hyundai Exter" src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/pwa/img/spacer3x2.png" data-gsll-src="https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_173507/930x620/Exter_Tracking_920250515_173507.jpg" title="Hyundai Exter"></p> 
<p><strong>Handling</strong></p> 
<p>On the highways, it does feel stable, and sudden lane changes don’t surprise you with too much body roll. Handling also feels safe and steering inspires confidence on twisty and winding roads. So if you are going to take this car to a mountainous area then you won't feel nervous at all.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">CarDekho recommends:</h2> 
<ul> 
 <li dir="ltr"> <p>If you want a basic car with all the important functional features on a budget, and don’t want to put aftermarket accessories, then you should go for the S EXE / S+ EXE(O) variant.</p> </li> 
 <li dir="ltr"> <p>The S/S+ variant can be considered if you want an automatic on a budget.</p> </li> 
 <li dir="ltr"> <p>Overall, the SX/SX Tech variants seem to be the sweet spot and most value-for-money variants in the Exter’s lineup.</p> </li>

About Exter</span><div class="contentheight"><div class="truncate3L" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 6;">If you re in the market for a stylish and feature-packed small SUV thats perfect for city commutes and the occasional highway trip, the Hyundai Exter is a great choice. It offers excellent value for money, plenty of modern features, and a smooth, comfortable drive. However, if you prefer sharper handling, need enough space at the back for three adults, or want a model with a confirmed crash-test rating, you might want to explore other options. Overall, the Exter ticks most boxes for first-time buyers and small families&nbsp; it?s practical, well-equipped, and looks great on the road.</div></div></div><div class="action " data-track-section="voting"><span class="hover"><i class="icon-cd-thumbup"></i> <!-- -->2</span><span class="hover"><i class="icon-cd-thumbdown"></i> </span></div></div></div></li><li class="gsc_col-xs-12 gsc_col-sm-12 gsc_col-md-4 gsc_col-lg-4" style="width: 33.3333%;"><div class="readReviewBox "><div class="readReviewHolder"><div class="authorInfo authordetail"><div class="authorThumb">P</div><div class="authorSummary"><div class="name">prem kumar<!-- --> on <!-- -->Nov 01, 2025</div><span><span class="ratingStarNew">4.7</span><span class="stars icon-star-full-fill"></span></span></div></div><div class="contentspace"><span class="title hover ">My Experience With Exter Knight Pro SX SE</span><div class="contentheight"><div class="truncate3L" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 6;">I bought this latest model oct 2025 built exter SX Knight Pro SE.

The cabin is so quiet that sometimes you have to check whether the car is on ignition or not. The features packed into this car will give jealous pangs to owners of cars that are 4-5 lakhs more expensive. The AMT is so good you may sometimes forget its not a pure automatic. The car is easy going, great for cities and stable on highways. The boot is quite big for its segment. From inside Exter appears more spacious than cars 1 segment above.

This is a car built with a major focus on commercial and utility purposes. And in that sense, the Eeco is a well-made car. But the moment you look at it from an all-rounder point of view, it has its fair share of misses.</p> \n<p>Having understood its category of buyers, it has just about the enough stuff that they would be in need of for their daily commutes, which includes a large boot and the ability to carry many people or loads of luggage or cargo while offering a good ride quality. So it doesn’t need the touchscreens or gadgets and creature comforts of the cars from today, though it still packs the absolute essentials.</p> \n<p>That said, we did feel Maruti should have upped its game a bit when it comes to giving the Eeco a little softer suspension along with equipping it with must-have features like power steering and central locking to further ease the driver’s duties. But all said and done, the basic people mover is indeed good at doing what it does the best and that’s moving people or cargo from its pickup point to the destination.</p> \n<p><strong><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/hyundai-exter/20250515_172024/930x620/Exter_Tracking_320250515_172024.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter\"></strong></p>","expertReviewTitle":"Hyundai Exter Overview"},{"title":"Exterior","description":"<p>While the Exter is not really an SUV, the design tries hard to portray it as one. Its tall, boxy, has flat profiles, and rugged cladding, all of these things do give it a butch look. And since it is a Hyundai, you also get some thoughtful premium touches.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter front three quarters\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172123/930x620/Exter_Beauty_1520250515_172123.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter front three quarters\"></p>  \n<p>At the front, the main highlights are the H-shaped DRLs which sit on top of the squarish halogen headlamps placed lower on the grille. The grille itself is pretty slim as Hyundai has added a chunky bumper with a skid plate to make the face look muscular.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter side profile\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172149/930x620/_61C135220250515_172149.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter side profile\"></p>   \n<p>From the side, the proportions look odd but they have tried to give a boxy look. The 15-inch dual-tone alloy wheels look good and the dual-tone colour also helps it look a little premium. Lower variants of the Exter get 14-inch steel and 15-inch styled steel wheels.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter 15-inch alloy wheels\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172240/930x620/_61C135120250515_172240.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter 15-inch alloy wheels\"></p>   \n<p>The rear profile of the Exter is a little polarising because it looks a little too flat, although Hyundai has tried to give some elements like these H-shaped LED taillights and the spoiler on top make the design also look digestible.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter rear\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172213/930x620/_61C135320250515_172213.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter rear\"></p>   \n<p>Hyundai offers the Exter in 8&nbsp;monotone shades: Ranger Khaki, Starry Night, Fiery Red, Atlas White, Titan Grey, Titan Grey Matte, Shadow Grey&nbsp;and Abyss Black. Atlas White and Ranger Khaki are also available in a dual-tone shade. If you want your Exter to look different, you can pick the Knight edition, which comes with a Shadow Grey exterior colour along with an all-black interior theme.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Hyundai is offering a Pro Pack with the Exter, which brings in bolder wheel arches and a silver side sill plate that makes it look more rugged than the regular model.</p> \n<p>While the Exter might not appeal to everyone, I for one liked the design, as it's something different, and that too done right. It fulfils the purpose of looking like a big car to a certain extent, and the one detail I liked the most was the lighting setup, which is on point.</p>","expertReviewTitle":"Hyundai Exter Exterior"},{"title":"Interior","description":"<p><strong>Design &amp; Quality</strong></p> \n<p>The Exter is tall, but not tall enough to cause issues during ingress and egress. With 185mm of ground clearance, getting inside is pretty easy. The wide opening doors and the tall roof make it even easier and effortless.</p> \n<p>Inside, the cabin design is the same as the Grand i10 Nios. The Exter’s interior has an all-black theme whose monotony is broken by its contrast-colour elements. You get these on the AC controls and AC vents, and these are body coloured. Even the piping on the seats are of the same exterior colour.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter interior\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172341/930x620/Exter_Interior_120250515_172341.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter interior\"></p> \n<p>The quality of the plastics used is also good. The one on the top is smooth and the 3D pattern looks good. However, the design is a bit too similar to Tata’s tri-arrow pattern. Other than that, all the controls – like the AC, buttons on the steering, and window switches – feel very tactile.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter AC vents\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172410/930x620/_61C136520250515_172410.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter AC vents\"></p> \n<p>Even the upholstery is a combination of fabric and leatherette which feels premium. But this high quality experience is limited to the upper part of the dashboard and the touchpoints. If the same was carried onto the door pads or the plastics below the dashboard, it would have been much better.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Front Seats</strong></p> \n<p>While the drive seat height adjustment is available from the base variant, tilt steering wheel adjustment is available from the SX Smart variant, so finding our ideal driving position will definitely require some time. But, the standard height of the seat should be right for most people.</p> \n<p>As for the front seats, they offer decent space. While the headroom is ample, the underthigh support is just average, and the seat is also a little narrow, which will not provide good space for broader individuals. The side support, on the other hand, is good.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Due to your tall driving position, wide windows and windshield, and no major blind spots, you get a commanding view of the road with good overall visibility.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter front seats\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172506/930x620/_61C136320250515_172506.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter front seats\"></p> \n<p><strong>Rear Seats</strong></p> \n<p>The seat cushioning is soft and the seat base is a little raised which allows you to sit comfortably. Knee room and foot room is ample even for someone 6ft tall, and the headroom is excellent. The only real issue starts when you try to seat three passengers here, as the limited width will make this quite a squeeze.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rear passengers also get good visibility due to the large windows, but the dark cabin theme can make them feel cramped. A rear centre armrest is also missing.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter rear seats\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172439/930x620/_61C138220250515_172439.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter rear seats\"></p> \n<p><strong>Storage Options</strong></p> \n<p>Front passengers get 1-litre bottle holders in both front doors, a big glovebox, two small cupholders in the centre console, an open storage on the dashboard, and a slot to keep your key.</p> \n<p>But the storage is a little less for rear passengers.

You have a type-C port and a USB port up front. The 12V socket has a wireless charger plug in but you can use it like a USB port. But if you want a 12V socket, you get that at the back as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The overall cabin experience of the Exter is nothing out of the ordinary, but Hyundai has done a nice job with the cabin quality and space. It is not a 5 seater, and there is room for improvement but the space and practicality is enough for four.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Features</strong></p> \n<p>Given its price and segment, the Hyundai Exter gets a good features list, and here are some of the daily use equipment.</p> \n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr> \n    <td colspan=\"2\">Features </td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>Auto AC with rear AC vents </td> \n    <td>Cruise control </td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>Push button start/stop </td> \n    <td>Keyless entry </td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>Electrically adjustable &amp; foldable ORVMs </td> \n    <td>Auto headlamps </td> \n   </tr> \n  </tbody> \n </table>\n</div> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter infotainment system\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172553/930x620/Exter_Interior_1120250515_172553.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter infotainment system\"></p> \n<p>You also get an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which has an easy to understand interface, big icons, and it rarely lags. Android Auto &amp; Apple CarPlay work as intended, however, they are wired only..</p>  \n<p>This setup is paired with a 4-speaker sound system which might not provide great audio quality, especially at higher volumes, but it's enough to get you through the day.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter driver's display\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_172618/930x620/_61C138720250515_172618.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter driver's display\"></p> \n<p>There’s also a semi-digital instrument cluster whose readouts are very big and clear and the MID in the centre is also very detailed.

There’s a single pane sunroof as well, which does bring in additional light into this dark cabin, and makes it feel a little airier.</p> \n<p>Then comes the dual-camera dash cam with a front and in-cabin camera.

This engine is also available with a factory-fitted CNG kit that is offered only with a manual transmission.</p> \n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr> \n    <td>Engine </td> \n    <td>1.2-litre NA Petrol </td> \n    <td>1.2-litre NA Petrol + CNG </td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>Power </td> \n    <td>83PS </td> \n    <td>69PS </td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>Torque </td> \n    <td>114Nm </td> \n    <td>95Nm </td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <td>Transmission </td> \n    <td>5MT, 5AMT </td> \n    <td>5MT </td> \n   </tr> \n  </tbody> \n </table>\n</div>  \n<p><strong>1.2-litre NA Petrol</strong></p> \n<p>As soon as you start driving, you realise that the refinement is good and the cabin remains quiet and relaxed at city speeds. However, this engine does feel a little lethargic at highway speeds and on inclines.</p> \n<p><strong>City Performance&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p>This engine is made for an effortless commute experience and not for performance seekers. However, when it comes to commuting, it is indeed effortless. The power delivery is very smooth and the acceleration linear. City overtakes and speed changes from 20 to 40kmph, and 40 to 60kmph are done easily.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter AMT gear lever\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_173234/930x620/Exter_Interior_1620250515_173234.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter AMT gear lever\">The Exter gets an AMT transmission for convenience and in my opinion, that is the one almost everyone should get. The logic behind its gear shift is very good and the gearbox understands when you have to downshift for acceleration, and again upshifts for cruising. This keeps the engine in a comfortable band, so you never feel the lack of power.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And most importantly, the gears shifts are quick, for AMT standards. Plus, for the first time, you get paddle shifters along with an AMT, for better manual control. If you don't want to spend extra, then the manual transmission won't let you complain either. The clutch is light, gear shifts slot in easily and the ease of driving is maintained.</p> \n<p>The fuel efficiency in the city will be around 13-14kmpl.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter \" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_173356/930x620/Exter_Tracking_3320250515_173356.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter \"></p> \n<p><strong>Highway Performance</strong></p> \n<p>As soon as you get on the highway, and start to accelerate, you realise that this engine starts to feel a bit out of breath. Overtakes over 80kmph will require a lot of accelerator usage and here the engine feels noisy as well. You will need to plan your overtakes in advance and getting to triple digit speeds will also take some time.</p> \n<p>If you are looking for an exciting drive, then this engine could feel disappointing. The lack of power is felt at higher revs and that is where a turbo petrol engine option could have come in handy. The Nios’ older 1-litre turbo petrol would be a perfect fit here. If Hyundai would have given that option, then this car could have proved to be a better all-rounder.</p>   \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter \" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_173303/930x620/Exter_Tracking_4420250515_173303.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter \"></p>","expertReviewTitle":"Hyundai Exter Performance"},{"title":"Ride and Handling","description":"<p><strong>Ride Comfort</strong></p> \n<p>The Hyundai Exter’s suspension is set up to focus more on low speed comfort.

We drove the Exter over bumpy roads, off the road and on the broken roads – and we can say that the suspension is very balanced. You don't feel the imperfection of the roads much and even the blogger bumps don't make you uncomfortable. Speedbreakers are well cushioned, and even the potholes won't make you feel nervous. And it is quick to settle as well so long road trips will also be comfortable.</p> \n<p>However, with a full passenger load, the bumps are felt more easily and while the ride is fine in the front row, rear seat occupants may find the suspension to be a bit bouncy at highway speeds.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Hyundai Exter\" src=\"https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/select-model/20250515_173507/930x620/Exter_Tracking_920250515_173507.jpg\" title=\"Hyundai Exter\"></p> \n<p><strong>Handling</strong></p> \n<p>On the highways, it does feel stable, and sudden lane changes don’t surprise you with too much body roll.
